**Scope**

**The objective of IFRS S1** _**General Requirements for Disclosure of Sustainability-**_
_**related Financial Information**_ **is to require an entity to disclose information**
**about its sustainability-related risks and opportunities that is useful to**
_**primary users of general purpose financial reports**_ **in making decisions relating**
**to providing resources to the entity.** [1]


Information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities is useful to
primary users because an entity ’ s ability to generate cash flows over the short,
medium and long term is inextricably linked to the interactions between the
entity and its stakeholders, society, the economy and the natural environment
throughout the entity ’ s _value chain_ . Together, the entity and the resources and
relationships throughout its value chain form an interdependent system in
which the entity operates. The entity ’ s dependencies on those resources and
relationships and its impacts on those resources and relationships give rise to
sustainability-related risks and opportunities for the entity.


**This Standard requires an entity to disclose information about all**
**sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be**
**expected to affect the entity** ’ **s cash flows, its access to finance or cost of**
**capital over the short, medium or long term. For the purposes of this**
**Standard, these risks and opportunities are collectively referred to as**
‘ **sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be**
**expected to affect the entity** ’ **s prospects** ’ **.**


This Standard also prescribes how an entity prepares and reports its
_sustainability-related financial disclosures_ . It sets out general requirements for the
content and presentation of those disclosures so that the information
disclosed is useful to primary users in making decisions relating to providing
resources to the entity.


**An entity shall apply this Standard in preparing and reporting**
**sustainability-related financial disclosures in accordance with** _**IFRS**_
_**Sustainability Disclosure Standards**_ **.**


Sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could not reasonably be
expected to affect an entity ’ s prospects are outside the scope of this Standard.


Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards specify information an entity is
required to disclose about specific sustainability-related risks and
opportunities.



1 Throughout this Standard, the terms ‘ primary users ’ and ‘ users ’ are used interchangeably, with
the same meaning.

IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


**An entity may apply IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards irrespective**
**of whether the entity** ’ **s related general purpose financial statements**
**(referred to as** ‘ **financial statements** ’ **) are prepared in accordance with IFRS**
**Accounting Standards or other generally accepted accounting principles or**
**practices (GAAP).**


This Standard uses terminology suitable for profit-oriented entities, including
public-sector business entities. If entities with not-for-profit activities in the
private sector or the public sector apply this Standard, they might need to
amend the descriptions used for particular items of information when
applying IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.



**Conceptual foundations**

**For sustainability-related financial information to be useful, it must be**
**relevant and faithfully represent what it purports to represent. These are**
**fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related**
**financial information. The usefulness of sustainability-related financial**
**information is enhanced if the information is comparable, verifiable,**
**timely and understandable. These are enhancing qualitative characteristics**
**of useful sustainability-related financial information (see Appendix D).**


**Fair presentation**


**A complete set of sustainability-related financial disclosures shall present**
**fairly all sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could**
**reasonably be expected to affect an entity** ’ **s prospects.**


To identify sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably
be expected to affect an entity ’ s prospects, an entity shall apply paragraphs
B1 - B12.


**Fair presentation requires disclosure of relevant information about**
**sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be**
**expected to affect the entity** ’ **s prospects, and their faithful representation**
**in accordance with the principles set out in this Standard. To achieve**
**faithful representation, an entity shall provide a complete, neutral and**
**accurate depiction of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities.**


Materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance based on the nature or
magnitude, or both, of the items to which the information relates, in the
context of the entity ’ s sustainability-related financial disclosures.


Fair presentation also requires an entity:


(a) to disclose information that is comparable, verifiable, timely and
understandable; and


(b) to disclose additional information if compliance with the specifically
applicable requirements in IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards is
insufficient to enable _users of general purpose financial reports_ to
understand the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities

Applying IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, with additional
information disclosed when necessary (see paragraph 15(b)), is presumed to
result in sustainability-related financial disclosures that achieve fair
presentation.


**Materiality**


**An entity shall disclose** _**material information**_ **about the sustainability-related**
**risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the**
**entity** ’ **s prospects.**


**In the context of sustainability-related financial disclosures, information is**
**material if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information could**
**reasonably be expected to influence decisions that primary users of general**
**purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports, which**
**include financial statements and sustainability-related financial disclosures**
**and which provide information about a specific** _**reporting entity**_ **.**


To identify and disclose material information, an entity shall apply paragraphs
B13 - B37.


**Reporting entity**

**An entity** ’ **s sustainability-related financial disclosures shall be for the same**
**reporting entity as the related financial statements (see paragraph B38).**


**Connected information**


**An entity shall provide information in a manner that enables users of**
**general purpose financial reports to understand the following types of**
**connections:**


**(a)** **the connections between the items to which the information relates**

  - **such as connections between various sustainability-related risks**
**and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the**
**entity** ’ **s prospects; and**


**(b)** **the connections between disclosures provided by the entity:**


**(i)** **within its sustainability-related financial disclosures**       - **such**
**as connections between disclosures on governance, strategy,**
**risk management and metrics and targets; and**


**(ii)** **across its sustainability-related financial disclosures and**
**other** _**general purpose financial reports**_ **published by the entity**

    - **such as its related financial statements (see paragraphs**
**B39**       - **B44).**


**An entity shall identify the financial statements to which the sustainability-**
**related financial disclosures relate.**

IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


**Data and assumptions used in preparing the sustainability-related financial**
**disclosures shall be consistent** - **to the extent possible considering the**
**requirements of IFRS Accounting Standards or other applicable GAAP** **with the corresponding data and assumptions used in preparing the**
**related financial statements (see paragraph B42).**


**When currency is specified as the unit of measure in the sustainability-**
**related financial disclosures, the entity shall use the presentation currency**
**of its related financial statements.**

**Unless another IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard permits or requires**
**otherwise in specified circumstances, an entity shall provide disclosures**
**about:**


**(a)** **governance** - **the governance processes, controls and procedures the**
**entity uses to monitor and manage sustainability-related risks and**
**opportunities (see paragraphs 26**    - **27);**


**(b)** **strategy** - **the approach the entity uses to manage sustainability-**
**related risks and opportunities (see paragraphs 28**    - **42);**


**(c)** **risk management** - **the processes the entity uses to identify, assess,**
**prioritise and monitor sustainability-related risks and opportunities**
**(see paragraphs 43**    - **44); and**


**(d)** **metrics and targets** - **the entity** ’ **s performance in relation to**
**sustainability-related risks and opportunities, including progress**
**towards any targets the entity has set or is required to meet by law**
**or regulation (see paragraphs 45**    - **53).**


**Governance**


**The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on governance**
**is to enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand the**
**governance processes, controls and procedures an entity uses to monitor,**
**manage and oversee sustainability-related risks and opportunities.**


To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose information about:


(a) the governance body(s) (which can include a board, committee or
equivalent body charged with governance) or individual(s) responsible
for oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities.
Specifically, the entity shall identify that body(s) or individual(s) and
disclose information about:


(i) how responsibilities for sustainability-related risks and
opportunities are reflected in the terms of reference, mandates,
role descriptions and other related policies applicable to that
body(s) or individual(s);


© IFRS Foundation 9


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023


(ii) how the body(s) or individual(s) determines whether
appropriate skills and competencies are available or will be
developed to oversee strategies designed to respond to
sustainability-related risks and opportunities;


(iii) how and how often the body(s) or individual(s) is informed
about sustainability-related risks and opportunities;


(iv) how the body(s) or individual(s) takes into account
sustainability-related risks and opportunities when overseeing
the entity ’ s strategy, its decisions on major transactions and its
risk management processes and related policies, including
whether the body(s) or individual(s) has considered trade-offs
associated with those risks and opportunities; and


(v) how the body(s) or individual(s) oversees the setting of targets
related to sustainability-related risks and opportunities, and
monitors progress towards those targets (see paragraph 51),
including whether and how related performance metrics are
included in remuneration policies.


(b) management ’ s role in the governance processes, controls and
procedures used to monitor, manage and oversee sustainability-related
risks and opportunities, including information about:


(i) whether the role is delegated to a specific management-level
position or management-level committee and how oversight is
exercised over that position or committee; and


(ii) whether management uses controls and procedures to support
the oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities
and, if so, how these controls and procedures are integrated
with other internal functions.


**Strategy**



28


29



**The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on strategy is to**
**enable users of general purpose financial reports to understand an entity** ’ **s**
**strategy for managing sustainability-related risks and opportunities.**


Specifically, an entity shall disclose information to enable users of general
purpose financial reports to understand:


(a) the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably
be expected to affect the entity ’ s prospects (see paragraphs 30     - 31);


(b) the current and anticipated effects of those sustainability-related risks
and opportunities on the entity ’ s _business model_ and value chain (see
paragraph 32);


(c) the effects of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities on
the entity ’ s strategy and decision-making (see paragraph 33);

IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


(d) the effects of those sustainability-related risks and opportunities on
the entity ’ s financial position, financial performance and cash flows
for the reporting period, and their anticipated effects on the entity ’ s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows over the
short, medium and long term, taking into consideration how those
sustainability-related risks and opportunities have been factored into
the entity ʼ s financial planning (see paragraphs 34     - 40); and


(e) the resilience of the entity ’ s strategy and its business model to those
sustainability-related risks (see paragraphs 41     - 42).


**Sustainability-related risks and opportunities**


An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose
financial reports to understand the sustainability-related risks and
opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity ’ s
prospects. Specifically, the entity shall:


(a) describe sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could
reasonably be expected to affect the entity ’ s prospects;


(b) specify the time horizons - short, medium or long term - over which
the effects of each of those sustainability-related risks and
opportunities could reasonably be expected to occur; and


(c) explain how the entity defines ‘ short term ’, ‘ medium term ’ and ‘ long
term ’ and how these definitions are linked to the planning horizons
used by the entity for strategic decision-making.


Short-, medium- and long- term time horizons can vary between entities and
depend on many factors, including industry-specific characteristics, such as
cash flow, investment and business cycles, the planning horizons typically
used in an entity ’ s industry for strategic decision-making and capital
allocation plans, and the time horizons over which users of general purpose
financial reports conduct their assessments of entities in that industry.


**Business model and value chain**


An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose
financial reports to understand the current and anticipated effects of
sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the entity ’ s business model
and value chain. Specifically, the entity shall disclose:


(a) a description of the current and anticipated effects of sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities on the entity ’ s business model and
value chain; and


(b) a description of where in the entity ’ s business model and value chain
sustainability-related risks and opportunities are concentrated (for
example, geographical areas, facilities and types of assets).

**Strategy and decision-making**



33


34


35



An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose
financial reports to understand the effects of sustainability-related risks and
opportunities on its strategy and decision-making. Specifically, the entity shall
disclose information about:


(a) how the entity has responded to, and plans to respond to,
sustainability-related risks and opportunities in its strategy and
decision-making;


(b) the progress against plans the entity has disclosed in previous
reporting periods, including quantitative and qualitative information;
and


(c) trade-offs between sustainability-related risks and opportunities that
the entity considered (for example, in making a decision on the
location of new operations, an entity might have considered the
environmental impacts of those operations and the employment
opportunities they would create in a community).


**Financial position, financial performance and cash flows**


An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose
financial reports to understand:


(a) the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the
entity ’ s financial position, financial performance and cash flows for
the reporting period (current financial effects); and


(b) the anticipated effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities
on the entity ’ s financial position, financial performance and cash flows
over the short, medium and long term, taking into consideration how
sustainability-related risks and opportunities are included in the
entity ’ s financial planning (anticipated financial effects).


Specifically, an entity shall disclose quantitative and qualitative information
about:


(a) how sustainability-related risks and opportunities have affected its
financial position, financial performance and cash flows for the
reporting period;


(b) the sustainability-related risks and opportunities identified in
paragraph 35(a) for which there is a significant risk of a material
adjustment within the next annual reporting period to the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities reported in the related financial
statements;


(c) how the entity expects its financial position to change over the short,
medium and long term, given its strategy to manage sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities, taking into consideration:



12 © IFRS Foundation


36


37


38


39


40



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


(i) its investment and disposal plans (for example, plans for capital
expenditure, major acquisitions and divestments, joint
ventures, business transformation, innovation, new business
areas, and asset retirements), including plans the entity is not
contractually committed to; and


(ii) its planned sources of funding to implement its strategy; and


(d) how the entity expects its financial performance and cash flows to
change over the short, medium and long term, given its strategy to
manage sustainability-related risks and opportunities.


In providing quantitative information, an entity may disclose a single amount
or a range.


In preparing disclosures about the anticipated financial effects of a
sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall:


(a) use all reasonable and supportable information that is available to the
entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort (see
paragraphs B8    - B10); and


(b) use an approach that is commensurate with the skills, capabilities and
resources that are available to the entity for preparing those
disclosures.


An entity need not provide quantitative information about the current or
anticipated financial effects of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity if
the entity determines that:


(a) those effects are not separately identifiable; or


(b) the level of measurement uncertainty involved in estimating those
effects is so high that the resulting quantitative information would not
be useful (see paragraphs 77    - 82).


In addition, an entity need not provide quantitative information about the
anticipated financial effects of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity if
the entity does not have the skills, capabilities or resources to provide that
quantitative information.


If an entity determines that it need not provide quantitative information
about the current or anticipated financial effects of a sustainability-related
risk or opportunity applying the criteria set out in paragraphs 38 - 39, the
entity shall:


(a) explain why it has not provided quantitative information;


(b) provide qualitative information about those financial effects, including
identifying line items, totals and subtotals within the related financial
statements that are likely to be affected, or have been affected, by that
sustainability-related risk or opportunity; and


© IFRS Foundation 13


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023


(c) provide quantitative information about the combined financial effects
of that sustainability-related risk or opportunity with other
sustainability-related risks or opportunities and other factors unless
the entity determines that quantitative information about the
combined financial effects would not be useful.


**Resilience**



41


42


43


44



An entity shall disclose information that enables users of general purpose
financial reports to understand its capacity to adjust to the uncertainties
arising from sustainability-related risks. An entity shall disclose a qualitative
and, if applicable, quantitative assessment of the resilience of its strategy and
business model in relation to its sustainability-related risks, including
information about how the assessment was carried out and its time horizon.
When providing quantitative information, an entity may disclose a single
amount or a range.


Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may specify the type of
information an entity is required to disclose about its resilience to specific
sustainability-related risks and how to prepare those disclosures, including
whether a _scenario analysis_ is required.


**Risk management**


**The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on risk**
**management is to enable users of general purpose financial reports:**


**(a)** **to understand an entity** ’ **s processes to identify, assess, prioritise and**
**monitor sustainability-related risks and opportunities, including**
**whether and how those processes are integrated into and inform**
**the entity** ’ **s overall risk management process; and**


**(b)** **to assess the entity** ’ **s overall risk profile and its overall risk**
**management process.**


To achieve this objective, an entity shall disclose information about:


(a) the processes and related policies the entity uses to identify, assess,
prioritise and monitor sustainability-related risks, including
information about:


(i) the inputs and parameters the entity uses (for example,
information about data sources and the scope of operations
covered in the processes);


(ii) whether and how the entity uses scenario analysis to inform its
identification of sustainability-related risks;


(iii) how the entity assesses the nature, likelihood and magnitude of
the effects of those risks (for example, whether the entity
considers qualitative factors, quantitative thresholds or other
criteria);


(iv) whether and how the entity prioritises sustainability-related
risks relative to other types of risk;

IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


(v) how the entity monitors sustainability-related risks; and


(vi) whether and how the entity has changed the processes it uses
compared with the previous reporting period;


(b) the processes the entity uses to identify, assess, prioritise and monitor
sustainability-related opportunities; and


(c) the extent to which, and how, the processes for identifying, assessing,
prioritising and monitoring sustainability-related risks and
opportunities are integrated into and inform the entity ’ s overall risk
management process.


**Metrics and targets**


**The objective of sustainability-related financial disclosures on metrics and**
**targets is to enable users of general purpose financial reports to**
**understand an entity** ’ **s performance in relation to its sustainability-related**
**risks and opportunities, including progress towards any targets the entity**
**has set, and any targets it is required to meet by law or regulation.**


**An entity shall disclose, for each sustainability-related risk and opportunity**
**that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity** ’ **s prospects:**


**(a)** **metrics required by an applicable IFRS Sustainability Disclosure**
**Standard; and**


**(b)** **metrics the entity uses to measure and monitor:**


**(i)** **that sustainability-related risk or opportunity; and**


**(ii)** **its performance in relation to that sustainability-related risk**
**or opportunity, including progress towards any targets the**
**entity has set, and any targets it is required to meet by law or**
**regulation.**


In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically
applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall apply
paragraphs 57 - 58 to identify applicable metrics.


**Metrics disclosed by an entity applying paragraphs 45** - **46 shall include**
**metrics associated with particular business models, activities or other**
**common features that characterise participation in an industry.**


If an entity discloses a metric taken from a source other than IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standards, the entity shall identify the source and
the metric taken.


If a metric has been developed by an entity, the entity shall disclose
information about:


(a) how the metric is defined, including whether it is derived by adjusting
a metric taken from a source other than IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standards and, if so, which source and how the metric disclosed by the
entity differs from the metric specified in that source;


© IFRS Foundation 15


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023


(b) whether the metric is an absolute measure, a measure expressed in
relation to another metric or a qualitative measure (such as a red,
amber, green        - or RAG        - status);


(c) whether the metric is validated by a third party and, if so, which party;
and


(d) the method used to calculate the metric and the inputs to the
calculation, including the limitations of the method used and the
significant assumptions made.



51


52


53



An entity shall disclose information about the targets it has set to monitor
progress towards achieving its strategic goals, and any targets it is required to
meet by law or regulation. For each target, the entity shall disclose:


(a) the metric used to set the target and to monitor progress towards
reaching the target;


(b) the specific quantitative or qualitative target the entity has set or is
required to meet;


(c) the period over which the target applies;


(d) the base period from which progress is measured;


(e) any milestones and interim targets;


(f) performance against each target and an analysis of trends or changes
in the entity ’ s performance; and


(g) any revisions to the target and an explanation for those revisions.


The definition and calculation of metrics, including metrics used to set the
entity ’ s targets and monitor progress towards reaching them, shall be
consistent over time. If a metric is redefined or replaced, an entity shall apply
paragraph B52.


An entity shall label and define metrics and targets using meaningful, clear
and precise names and descriptions.



**General requirements**


**Sources of guidance**


**Identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities**



54


55



In identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could
reasonably be expected to affect an entity ’ s prospects, an entity shall apply
IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.


In addition to IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards:


(a) an entity shall refer to and consider the applicability of the _disclosure_
_topics_ [in the SASB Standards. An entity might conclude that the](https://sasb.org/standards/download/)
disclosure topics in the SASB Standards are not applicable in the
entity ’ s circumstances.

IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


(b) an entity may refer to and consider the applicability of:


(i) the CDSB Framework Application Guidance for Water-related
Disclosures and the CDSB Framework Application Guidance for
Biodiversity-related Disclosures (collectively referred to as
‘ [CDSB Framework Application Guidance](https://www.ifrs.org/content/dam/ifrs/publications/cdsb/cdsb-framework-2022.pdf) ’ );


(ii) the most recent pronouncements of other standard       - setting
bodies whose requirements are designed to meet the
information needs of users of general purpose financial reports;
and


(iii) the sustainability-related risks and opportunities identified by
entities that operate in the same industry(s) or geographical
region(s).


**Identifying applicable disclosure requirements**


In identifying applicable disclosure requirements about a sustainabilityrelated risk or opportunity that could reasonably be expected to affect an
entity ’ s prospects, an entity shall apply the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standard that specifically applies to that sustainability-related risk or
opportunity.


In the absence of an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically
applies to a sustainability-related risk or opportunity, an entity shall apply
judgement to identify information that:


(a) is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial
reports; and


(b) faithfully represents that sustainability-related risk or opportunity.


In making the judgement described in paragraph 57:


(a) an entity shall refer to and consider the applicability of the metrics
associated with the disclosure topics included in the SASB Standards.
An entity might conclude that the metrics specified in the SASB
Standards are not applicable in the entity ’ s circumstances.


(b) an entity may - to the extent that these sources do not conflict with
IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards    - refer to and consider the

consider the applicability of the sources specified in Appendix C.


**Disclosure of information about sources of guidance**



59


60


61


62


63



An entity shall identify:


(a) the specific standards, pronouncements, industry practice and other
sources of guidance that the entity has applied in preparing its
sustainability-related financial disclosures, including, if applicable,
identifying the disclosure topics in the SASB Standards; and


(b) the industry(s) specified in the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standards, the SASB Standards or other sources of guidance relating to
a particular industry(s) that the entity has applied in preparing its
sustainability-related financial disclosures, including in identifying
applicable metrics.


**Location of disclosures**


**An entity is required to provide disclosures required by IFRS Sustainability**
**Disclosure Standards as part of its general purpose financial reports.**


Subject to any regulation or other requirements that apply to an entity, there
are various possible locations in its general purpose financial reports in which
to disclose sustainability-related financial information. Sustainability-related
financial disclosures could be included in an entity ’ s management
commentary or a similar report when it forms part of an entity ’ s general
purpose financial reports. Management commentary or a similar report is a
required report in many jurisdictions. It might be known by or included in
reports with various names, such as ‘ management report ’, ‘ management ’ s
discussion and analysis ’, ‘ operating and financial review ’, ‘ integrated report ’ or
‘ strategic report ’ .


An entity may disclose information required by an IFRS Sustainability
Disclosure Standard in the same location as information disclosed to meet
other requirements, such as information required by regulators. The entity
shall ensure that the sustainability-related financial disclosures are clearly
identifiable and not obscured by that additional information (see
paragraph B27).


Information required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard may be
included in sustainability-related financial disclosures by cross-reference to
another report published by the entity. If an entity includes information by
cross-reference, the entity shall apply the requirements in paragraphs
B45 - B47.

IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


**Timing of reporting**


**An entity shall report its sustainability-related financial disclosures at the**
**same time as its related financial statements. The entity** ’ **s sustainability-**
**related financial disclosures shall cover the same reporting period as the**
**related financial statements.**


Normally, an entity prepares sustainability-related financial disclosures for a
12-month period. However, for practical reasons, some entities prefer to
report, for example, for a 52-week period. This Standard does not preclude
that practice.


When an entity changes the end of its reporting period and provides
sustainability-related financial disclosures for a period longer or shorter than
12 months, it shall disclose:


(a) the period covered by the sustainability-related financial disclosures;


(b) the reason for using a longer or shorter period; and


(c) the fact that the amounts disclosed in the sustainability-related
financial disclosures are not entirely comparable.


If, after the end of the reporting period but before the date on which the
sustainability-related financial disclosures are authorised for issue, an entity
receives information about conditions that existed at the end of the reporting
period, it shall update disclosures that relate to those conditions in the light of
the new information.


An entity shall disclose information about transactions, other events and
conditions that occur after the end of the reporting period, but before the date
on which the sustainability-related financial disclosures are authorised for
issue, if non-disclosure of that information could reasonably be expected to
influence decisions that primary users of general purpose financial reports
make on the basis of those reports.


This Standard does not mandate which entities would be required to provide
interim sustainability-related financial disclosures, how frequently, or how
soon after the end of an interim period. However, governments, securities
regulators, stock exchanges and accountancy bodies may require entities
whose debt or equity securities are publicly traded to publish interim general
purpose financial reports. If an entity is required or elects to publish interim
sustainability-related financial disclosures in accordance with IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standards, the entity shall apply paragraph B48.


**Comparative information**


**Unless another IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard permits or requires**
**otherwise, an entity shall disclose comparative information in respect of**
**the preceding period for all amounts disclosed in the reporting period. If**
**such information would be useful for an understanding of the**
**sustainability-related financial disclosures for the reporting period, the**
**entity shall also disclose comparative information for narrative and**


© IFRS Foundation 19


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023


**descriptive sustainability-related financial information (see paragraphs**
**B49**    - **B59).**



71


72


73



Amounts reported in sustainability-related financial disclosures might relate,
for example, to metrics and targets or to current and anticipated financial
effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities.


**Statement of compliance**


**An entity whose sustainability-related financial disclosures comply with all**
**the requirements of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards shall make an**
**explicit and unreserved statement of compliance. An entity shall not**
**describe sustainability-related financial disclosures as complying with IFRS**
**Sustainability Disclosure Standards unless they comply with all the**
**requirements of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards.**


This Standard relieves an entity from disclosing information otherwise
required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard if law or regulation
prohibits the entity from disclosing that information (see paragraph B33). This
Standard also relieves an entity from disclosing information about a
sustainability-related opportunity otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability
Disclosure Standard if that information is commercially sensitive as described
in this Standard (see paragraphs B34 - B37). An entity using these exemptions is
not prevented from asserting compliance with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standards.



**Judgements, uncertainties and errors**


**Judgements**



74


75



**An entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose**
**financial reports to understand the judgements, apart from those involving**
**estimations of amounts (see paragraph 77), that the entity has made in the**
**process of preparing its sustainability-related financial disclosures and that**
**have the most significant effect on the information included in those**
**disclosures.**


In the process of preparing sustainability-related financial disclosures, an
entity makes various judgements, apart from those involving estimations, that
can significantly affect the information reported in the entity ’ s sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures. For example, an entity makes judgements in:


(a) identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could be
reasonably expected to affect the entity ’ s prospects;


(b) determining which sources of guidance to apply in accordance with
paragraphs 54    - 58;


(c) identifying material information to include in the sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures; and

81



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


(d) assessing whether an event or change in circumstances is significant
and requires reassessment of the scope of all affected sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities throughout the entity ’ s value chain (see
paragraph B11).


Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may require disclosure of some
of the information that an entity would otherwise be required to disclose in
accordance with paragraph 74.


**Measurement uncertainty**


**An entity shall disclose information to enable users of general purpose**
**financial reports to understand the most significant uncertainties affecting**
**the amounts reported in its sustainability-related financial disclosures.**


**An entity shall:**


**(a)** **identify the amounts that it has disclosed that are subject to a high**
**level of measurement uncertainty; and**


**(b)** **in relation to each amount identified in paragraph 78(a), disclose**
**information about:**


**(i)** **the sources of measurement uncertainty**       - **for example, the**
**dependence of the amount on the outcome of a future event,**
**on a measurement technique or on the availability and**
**quality of data from the entity** ’ **s value chain; and**


**(ii)** **the assumptions, approximations and judgements the entity**
**has made in measuring the amount.**


When amounts reported in sustainability-related financial disclosures cannot
be measured directly and can only be estimated, measurement uncertainty
arises. In some cases, an estimate involves assumptions about possible future
events with uncertain outcomes. The use of reasonable estimates is an
essential part of preparing sustainability-related financial disclosures and does
not undermine the usefulness of the information if the estimates are
accurately described and explained. Even a high level of measurement
uncertainty would not necessarily prevent such an estimate from providing
useful information.


The requirement in paragraph 77 for an entity to disclose information about
the uncertainties affecting the amounts reported in sustainability-related
financial disclosures relates to the estimates that require the entity ’ s most
difficult, subjective or complex judgements. As the number of variables and
assumptions increases, those judgements become more subjective and
complex, and the uncertainty affecting the amounts reported in the
sustainability-related financial disclosures increases accordingly.


The type and extent of the information an entity might need to disclose vary
according to the nature of the amount reported in the sustainability-related
financial disclosures - the sources of and the factors contributing to the
uncertainty and other circumstances. Examples of the type of information an
entity might need to disclose are:


© IFRS Foundation 21


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023


(a) the nature of the assumption or other source of measurement
uncertainty;


(b) the sensitivity of the disclosed amount to the methods, assumptions
and estimates underlying its calculation, including the reasons for the
sensitivity;


(c) the expected resolution of an uncertainty and the range of reasonably
possible outcomes for the disclosed amount; and


(d) an explanation of changes made to past assumptions concerning the
disclosed amount, if the uncertainty remains unresolved.



82


83


84


85


86



Other IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards may require disclosure of some
of the information that an entity would otherwise be required to disclose in
accordance with paragraphs 77 - 78.


**Errors**


**An entity shall correct material prior period errors by restating the**
**comparative amounts for the prior period(s) disclosed unless it is**
_**impracticable**_ **to do so.**


Prior period errors are omissions from and misstatements in the entity ’ s
sustainability-related financial disclosures for one or more prior periods. Such
errors arise from a failure to use, or the misuse of, reliable information that:


(a) was available when the sustainability-related financial disclosures for
that period(s) were authorised for issue; and


(b) could reasonably be expected to have been obtained and considered in
the preparation of those disclosures.


Corrections of errors are distinguished from changes in estimates. Estimates
are approximations that an entity might need to revise as additional
information becomes known.


If an entity identifies a material error in its prior period sustainability-related
financial disclosures, it shall apply paragraphs B55 - B59.

IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


**Appendix B**
**Application guidance**


_This appendix is an integral part of IFRS S1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the_
_Standard._


**Sustainability-related risks and opportunities (paragraphs 11** - **12)**



B1


B2


B3



This Standard requires an entity to disclose information about all
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be
expected to affect the entity ’ s cash flows, its access to finance or cost of capital
over the short, medium or long term (referred to as ‘ sustainability-related
risks and opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect the entity ’ s
prospects ’ ) (see paragraph 3).


An entity ’ s sustainability-related risks and opportunities arise out of the
interactions between the entity and its stakeholders, society, the economy and
the natural environment throughout the entity ’ s value chain. These
interactions - which can be direct and indirect - result from operating an
entity ’ s business model in pursuit of the entity ’ s strategic purposes and from
the external environment in which the entity operates. These interactions
take place within an interdependent system in which an entity both depends
on resources and relationships throughout its value chain to generate cash
flows and affects those resources and relationships through its activities and
outputs - contributing to the preservation, regeneration and development of
those resources and relationships or to their degradation and depletion. These
dependencies and impacts might give rise to sustainability-related risks and
opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity ’ s cash
flows, its access to finance and cost of capital over the short, medium and long
term.


For example, if an entity ’ s business model depends on a natural resource such as water - the entity could both affect and be affected by the quality,
availability and affordability of that resource. Specifically, degradation or
depletion of that resource - including resulting from the entity ’ s own
activities and from other factors - could create a risk of disruption to the
entity ’ s operations and affect the entity ’ s business model or strategy and could
ultimately negatively affect the entity ’ s financial performance and financial
position. In contrast, regeneration and preservation of that resource including resulting from the entity ’ s own activities and from other factors could positively affect the entity. Similarly, if an entity operates in a highly
competitive market and requires a highly specialised workforce to achieve its
strategic purposes, the entity ’ s future success will likely depend on the entity ’ s
ability to attract and retain that resource. At the same time, that ability will
depend, in part, on the entity ’ s employment practices - such as whether the
entity invests in employee training and wellbeing - and the levels of employee
satisfaction, engagement and retention. These examples illustrate the close
relationship between the value the entity creates, preserves or erodes for
others and the entity ’ s own ability to succeed and achieve its goals.

Resources and relationships that an entity depends on and affects by its
activities and outputs can take various forms, such as natural, manufactured,
intellectual, human, social or financial. They can be internal - such as the
entity ’ s workforce, its know-how or its organisational processes - or they can
be external - such as materials and services the entity needs to access or the
relationships it has with suppliers, distributors and customers. Furthermore,
resources and relationships include, but are not limited to, the resources and
relationships recognised as assets in the entity ’ s financial statements.


An entity ’ s dependencies and impacts are not limited to resources the entity
engages with directly, and to the entity ’ s direct relationships. Those
dependencies and impacts also relate to resources and relationships
throughout the entity ’ s value chain. For example, they can relate to the
entity ’ s supply and distribution channels; the effects of the consumption and
disposal of the entity ’ s products; and the entity ’ s sources of finance and its
investments, including investments in associates and joint ventures. If the
entity ’ s business partners throughout its value chain face sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities, the entity could be exposed to related
consequences of its own.


**Identifying sustainability-related risks and opportunities**


An entity shall use all reasonable and supportable information that is
available to the entity at the reporting date without undue cost or effort (see
paragraphs B8 - B10):


(a) to identify the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could
reasonably be expected to affect the entity ’ s prospects; and


(b) to determine the scope of its value chain, including its breadth and
composition, in relation to each of those sustainability-related risks
and opportunities.


In identifying the sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could
reasonably be expected to affect its prospects, an entity shall apply the
requirements on sources of guidance in paragraphs 54 - 55.


**Reasonable and supportable information**


Reasonable and supportable information used by an entity in preparing its
sustainability-related financial disclosures shall cover factors that are specific
to the entity as well as general conditions in the external environment. In
some cases - such as in identifying sustainability-related risks and
opportunities that could reasonably be expected to affect an entity ’ s prospects

- reasonable and supportable information includes information about past
events, current conditions and forecasts of future conditions. Other IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standards may specify what is reasonable and
supportable information in specific cases.



26 © IFRS Foundation


B9


B10


B11


B12



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


An entity may use various sources of data that may be both internal and
external. Possible data sources include the entity ’ s risk management
processes; industry and peer group experience; and external ratings, reports
and statistics. Information that is used by the entity in preparing its financial
statements, operating its business model, setting its strategy and managing its
risks and opportunities is considered to be available to the entity without
undue cost or effort.


An entity need not undertake an exhaustive search for information to identify
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be
expected to affect the entity ’ s prospects. The assessment of what constitutes
undue cost or effort depends on the entity ’ s specific circumstances and
requires a balanced consideration of the costs and efforts for the entity and
the benefits of the resulting information for primary users. That assessment
can change over time as circumstances change.


**Reassessment of the scope of sustainability-related risks**
**and opportunities throughout the value chain**


On the occurrence of a significant event or significant change in
circumstances, an entity shall reassess the scope of all affected sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities throughout its value chain. A significant event
or significant change in circumstances can occur without the entity being
involved in that event or change in circumstances or as a result of a change in
what the entity assesses to be important to users of general purpose financial
reports. For example, such significant events or significant changes in
circumstances might include:


(a) a significant change in the entity ’ s value chain (for example, a supplier
in the entity ’ s value chain makes a change that significantly alters the
supplier ’ s greenhouse gas emissions);


(b) a significant change in the entity ’ s business model, activities or
corporate structure (for example, a merger or acquisition that expands
the entity ’ s value chain); and


(c) a significant change in an entity ’ s exposure to sustainability-related
risks and opportunities (for example, a supplier in the entity ’ s value
chain is affected by the introduction of a new regulation that the
entity had not anticipated).


An entity is permitted, but not required, to reassess the scope of any
sustainability-related risk or opportunity throughout its value chain more
frequently than required by paragraph B11.



**Materiality (paragraphs 17** - **19)**



B13



Paragraph 17 requires an entity to disclose material information about the
sustainability-related risks and opportunities that could reasonably be
expected to affect the entity ’ s prospects. Materiality of information is judged
in relation to whether omitting, misstating or obscuring that information
could reasonably be expected to influence decisions of primary users of


© IFRS Foundation 27


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023


general purpose financial reports, which provide information about a specific
reporting entity.



B14


B15


B16


B17


B18


B19


B20



The decisions of primary users relate to providing resources to the entity and
involve decisions about:


(a) buying, selling or holding equity and debt instruments;


(b) providing or selling loans and other forms of credit; or


(c) exercising rights to vote on, or otherwise influence, the entity ’ s
management ’ s actions that affect the use of the entity ’ s economic
resources.


The decisions described in paragraph B14 depend on primary users ’
expectations about returns, for example, dividends, principal and interest
payments or market price increases. Those expectations depend on primary
users ’ assessment of the amount, timing and uncertainty of future net cash
inflows to the entity and on their assessment of stewardship of the entity ’ s
economic resources by the entity ’ s management and its governing body(s) or
individual(s).


Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence the
decisions made by primary users requires consideration of the characteristics
of those users and of the entity ’ s own circumstances.


Sustainability-related financial disclosures are prepared for primary users who
have reasonable knowledge of business and economic activities and who
review and analyse information diligently. At times, even well-informed and
diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand
sustainability-related financial information.


Individual primary users may have different, and sometimes even conflicting,
information needs and desires. Information needs of primary users may also
evolve over time. Sustainability-related financial disclosures are intended to
meet common information needs of primary users.


**Identifying material information**


Materiality judgements are specific to an entity. Consequently, this Standard
does not specify any thresholds for materiality or predetermine what would
be material in a particular situation.


To identify material information about a sustainability-related risk or
opportunity, an entity shall apply, as the starting point, the requirements of
the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to that
sustainability-related risk or opportunity. In the absence of an IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to a sustainabilityrelated risk or opportunity, the entity shall apply the requirements on sources
of guidance specified in paragraphs 57 - 58. Those sources specify information,
including metrics, that may be relevant to a particular sustainability-related
risk or opportunity, to a particular industry or in specified circumstances.



28 © IFRS Foundation


B21


B22


B23


B24


B25



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


An entity shall assess whether the information identified in applying
paragraph B20, either individually or in combination with other information,
is material in the context of the entity ’ s sustainability-related financial
disclosures taken as a whole. In assessing whether information is material, an
entity shall consider both quantitative and qualitative factors. For example, an
entity might consider the magnitude and the nature of the effect of a
sustainability-related risk or opportunity on the entity.


In some cases, IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards require the disclosure
of information about possible future events with uncertain outcomes. In
judging whether information about such possible future events is material, an
entity shall consider:


(a) the potential effects of the events on the amount, timing and
uncertainty of the entity ’ s future cash flows over the short, medium
and long term (referred to as ‘ the possible outcome ’ ); and


(b) the range of possible outcomes and the likelihood of the possible
outcomes within that range.


When considering possible outcomes, an entity shall consider all pertinent
facts and circumstances. Information about a possible future event is more
likely to be judged as being material if the potential effects are significant and
the event is likely to occur. However, an entity shall also consider whether
information about low-probability and high-impact outcomes might be
material either individually or in combination with information about other
low-probability and high-impact outcomes. For example, an entity might be
exposed to several sustainability-related risks, each of which could cause the
same type of disruption - such as disruption to the entity ’ s supply chain.
Information about an individual source of risk might not be material if
disruption from that source is highly unlikely to occur. However, information
about the aggregate risk - the risk of supply chain disruption from all sources

- might be material.


If a possible future event is expected to affect an entity ’ s cash flows, but only
many years in the future, information about that event is usually less likely to
be judged material than information about a possible future event with
similar effects that are expected to occur sooner. However, in some
circumstances, an item of information could reasonably be expected to
influence primary users ’ decisions regardless of the magnitude of the
potential effects of the future event or the timing of that event. For example,
this might happen if information about a particular sustainability-related risk
or opportunity is highly scrutinised by primary users of an entity ’ s general
purpose financial reports.


An entity need not disclose information otherwise required by an IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standard if the information is not material. This is
the case even if the IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard contains a list of
specific requirements or describes them as minimum requirements.


© IFRS Foundation 29


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023



B26


B27


B28


B29



An entity shall disclose additional information when compliance with the
specifically applicable requirements in an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standard is insufficient to enable users of general purpose financial reports to
understand the effects of sustainability-related risks and opportunities on the
entity ’ s cash flows, its access to finance and cost of capital over the short,
medium and long term.


An entity shall identify its sustainability-related financial disclosures clearly
and distinguish them from other information provided by the entity (see
paragraph 62). An entity shall not obscure material information. Information
is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for
primary users to omitting or misstating that information. Examples of
circumstances that might result in material information being obscured
include:


(a) material information is not clearly distinguished from additional
information that is not material;


(b) material information is disclosed in the sustainability-related financial
disclosures, but the language used is vague or unclear;


(c) material information about a sustainability-related risk or opportunity
is scattered throughout the sustainability-related financial disclosures;


(d) items of information that are dissimilar are inappropriately
aggregated;


(e) items of information that are similar are inappropriately
disaggregated; and


(f) the understandability of the sustainability-related financial disclosures
is reduced as a result of material information being hidden by
immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to
determine what information is material.


An entity shall reassess its materiality judgements at each reporting date to
take account of changed circumstances and assumptions. Because of changes
in the entity ’ s individual circumstances, or in the external environment, some
types of information included in an entity ’ s sustainability-related financial
disclosures for prior periods might no longer be material. Conversely, some
types of information not previously disclosed might become material.


**Aggregation and disaggregation**


When an entity applies IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards, it shall
consider all facts and circumstances and decide how to aggregate and
disaggregate information in its sustainability-related financial disclosures. The
entity shall not reduce the understandability of its sustainability-related
financial disclosures by obscuring material information with immaterial
information or by aggregating material items of information that are
dissimilar to each other.

B30


B31


B32


B33

B35



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


An entity shall not aggregate information if doing so would obscure
information that is material. Information shall be aggregated if items of
information have shared characteristics and shall not be aggregated if they do
not have shared characteristics. The entity might need to disaggregate
information about sustainability-related risks and opportunities, for example,
by geographical location or in consideration of the geopolitical environment.
For example, to ensure that material information is not obscured, an entity
might need to disaggregate information about its use of water to distinguish
between water drawn from abundant sources and water drawn from waterstressed areas.


**Interaction with law or regulation**


Law or regulation might specify requirements for an entity to disclose
sustainability-related information in its general purpose financial reports. In
such circumstances, the entity is permitted to include in its sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures information to meet legal or regulatory
requirements, even if that information is not material. However, such
information shall not obscure material information.


An entity shall disclose material sustainability-related financial information,
even if law or regulation permits the entity not to disclose such information.


An entity need not disclose information otherwise required by an IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standard if law or regulation prohibits the entity
from disclosing that information. If an entity omits material information for
that reason, it shall identify the type of information not disclosed and explain
the source of the restriction.


**Commercially sensitive information**


If an entity determines that information about a sustainability-related
opportunity is commercially sensitive in the limited circumstances described
in paragraph B35, the entity is permitted to omit that information from its
sustainability-related financial disclosures. Such an omission is permitted even
if information is otherwise required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standard and the information is material.


An entity qualifies for the exemption specified in paragraph B34 if, and only
if:


(a) information about the sustainability-related opportunity is not already
publicly available;


(b) disclosure of that information could reasonably be expected to
prejudice seriously the economic benefits the entity would otherwise
be able to realise in pursuing the opportunity; and


(c) the entity has determined that it is impossible to disclose that
information in a manner    - for example, at an aggregated level    - that
would enable the entity to meet the objectives of the disclosure
requirements without prejudicing seriously the economic benefits the
entity would otherwise be able to realise in pursuing the opportunity.

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023



B36


B37



If an entity elects to use the exemption specified in paragraph B34, the entity
shall, for each item of information omitted:


(a) disclose the fact that it has used the exemption; and


(b) reassess, at each reporting date, whether the information qualifies for
the exemption.


An entity is prohibited from using the exemption specified in paragraph B34
in relation to a sustainability-related risk or as a basis for broad non-disclosure
of sustainability-related financial information.



**Reporting entity (paragraph 20)**



B38



Paragraph 20 requires that sustainability-related financial disclosures shall be
for the same reporting entity as the related financial statements. For example,
consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS
Accounting Standards provide information about the parent and its
subsidiaries as a single reporting entity. Consequently, that entity ’ s
sustainability-related financial disclosures shall enable users of general
purpose financial reports to understand the effects of the sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities on the cash flows, access to finance and cost of
capital over the short, medium and long term for the parent and its
subsidiaries.



**Connected information (paragraphs 21** - **24)**



B39


B40


B41



Paragraph 21 requires an entity to provide information in a manner that
enables users of general purpose financial reports to understand connections
both between the items to which the information relates and between
disclosures provided by the entity in its general purpose financial reports.


Connected information provides insight into connections between the items to
which the information relates. For example:


(a) if an entity pursued a particular sustainability-related opportunity and
that resulted in an increase in the entity ’ s revenue, connected
information will depict that relationship between the entity ’ s strategy
and its financial performance;


(b) if an entity identified a trade-off between two sustainability-related
risks it is exposed to and took action on the basis of its assessment of
that trade-off, connected information will depict the relationship
between those risks and the entity ’ s strategy; and


(c) if an entity committed to a particular sustainability-related target, but
that commitment has not yet affected the entity ’ s financial position or
financial performance because the applicable recognition criteria have
not been met, connected information will depict that relationship.


Connected information includes:


(a) connections between various types of information about a particular
sustainability-related risk or opportunity, such as:



32 © IFRS Foundation


B42


B43


B44



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


(i) between disclosures on governance, strategy and risk
management; and


(ii) between narrative information and quantitative information
(including related metrics and targets and information in the
related financial statements).


(b) connections between disclosures about various sustainability-related
risks and opportunities. For example, if an entity integrates its
oversight of sustainability-related risks and opportunities, the entity
shall integrate the disclosures on governance instead of providing
separate disclosures on governance for each sustainability-related risk
and opportunity.


Drawing connections between disclosures involves, but is not limited to,
providing necessary explanations and cross-references and using consistent
data, assumptions, and units of measure. In providing connected information,
an entity shall:


(a) explain connections between disclosures in a clear and concise
manner;


(b) avoid unnecessary duplication if IFRS Sustainability Disclosure
Standards require the disclosure of common items of information; and


(c) disclose information about significant differences between the data
and assumptions used in preparing the entity ’ s sustainability-related
financial disclosures and the data and assumptions used in preparing
the related financial statements.


For example, in providing connected information an entity might need to
explain the effect or likely effect of its strategy on its financial statements and
financial planning, or explain how that strategy relates to the metrics the
entity uses to measure progress against targets. Another entity might need to
explain how its use of natural resources or changes within its supply chain
could amplify or, in contrast, reduce its sustainability-related risks and
opportunities. The entity might need to link the information about its use of
natural resources or changes within its supply chain to information about
current or anticipated financial effects on the entity ’ s production costs, its
strategic response to mitigate those risks and its related investment in new
assets. The entity might need to link narrative information to the related
metrics and targets and to information in the related financial statements.


Other examples of connected information include:


(a) an explanation of the combined effects of the entity ’ s sustainabilityrelated risks and opportunities and its strategy on its financial
position, financial performance and cash flows over the short, medium
and long term. For example, an entity might face decreasing demand
for its products because of consumer preferences for lower-carbon
alternatives. The entity might need to explain how its strategic
response, such as closing a major factory, could affect its workforce


© IFRS Foundation 33


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION       - JUNE 2023


and local communities, and the effect of such a closure on the useful
lives of its assets and on impairment assessments.


(b) a description of the alternatives that an entity evaluated in setting its
strategy in response to its sustainability-related risks and
opportunities, including a description of the trade-offs between those
risks and opportunities that the entity considered (see paragraph 33(c)).
For example, an entity might need to explain the potential effects of its
decision to restructure its operations in response to a sustainabilityrelated risk on the future size and composition of the entity ’ s
workforce.


**Information included by cross-reference (paragraph 63)**



B45


B46


B47



Information required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard might be
available in another report published by the entity. For example, the required
information could be disclosed in the related financial statements. Material
information can be included in an entity ’ s sustainability-related financial
disclosures by cross-reference, provided that:


(a) the cross-referenced information is available on the same terms and at
the same time as the sustainability-related financial disclosures; and


(b) the complete set of sustainability-related financial disclosures is not
made less understandable by including information by cross-reference.


Information included by cross-reference becomes part of the complete set of
sustainability-related financial disclosures and shall comply with the
requirements of IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards. For example, it
needs to be relevant, representationally faithful, comparable, verifiable, timely
and understandable. The body(s) or individual(s) that authorises the general
purpose financial reports takes the same responsibility for the information
included by cross-reference as it does for the information included directly.


If information required by an IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standard is
included by cross-reference:


(a) the sustainability-related financial disclosures shall clearly identify the
report within which that information is located and explain how to
access that report; and


(b) the cross-reference shall be to a precisely specified part of that report.



**Interim reporting (paragraph 69)**



B48



In the interest of timeliness and cost considerations, and to avoid repetition of
information previously reported, an entity may be required or choose to
provide less information at interim dates than it provides in its annual
sustainability-related financial disclosures. Interim sustainability-related
financial disclosures are intended to provide an update on the latest complete
set of annual disclosures of sustainability-related financial information. These
disclosures focus on new information, events and circumstances and do not
duplicate information previously reported. Although the information



34 © IFRS Foundation


IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


provided in interim sustainability-related financial disclosures may be more
condensed than in annual sustainability-related financial disclosures, an
entity is not prohibited or discouraged from publishing a complete set of
sustainability-related financial disclosures as specified in this Standard as part
of its interim general purpose financial report.


**Comparative information (paragraphs 52, 70 and 83** - **86)**



B49


B50


B51


B52


B53


B54



Paragraph 70 requires an entity to disclose comparative information in respect
of the preceding period for all amounts disclosed in the reporting period.


**Metrics**


In some cases, the amount disclosed for a metric is an estimate. Except as
specified in paragraph B51, if an entity identifies new information in relation
to the estimated amount disclosed in the preceding period and the new
information provides evidence of circumstances that existed in that period,
the entity shall:


(a) disclose a revised comparative amount that reflects that new
information;


(b) disclose the difference between the amount disclosed in the preceding
period and the revised comparative amount; and


(c) explain the reasons for revising the comparative amount.


In applying the requirement in paragraph B50, an entity need not disclose a
revised comparative amount:


(a) if it is impracticable to do so (see paragraph B54).


(b) if the metric is forward-looking. Forward-looking metrics relate to
possible future transactions, events and other conditions. The entity is
permitted to revise a comparative amount for a forward-looking metric
if doing so does not involve the use of hindsight.


If an entity redefines or replaces a metric in the reporting period, the entity
shall:


(a) disclose a revised comparative amount, unless it is impracticable to do
so;


(b) explain the changes; and


(c) explain the reasons for those changes, including why the redefined or
replacement metric provides more useful information.


If an entity introduces a new metric in the reporting period, it shall disclose a
comparative amount for that metric unless it is impracticable to do so.


Sometimes, it is impracticable to revise a comparative amount to achieve
comparability with the reporting period. For example, data might not have
been collected in the preceding period in a way that allows retrospective
application of a new definition of a metric, and it might be impracticable to


© IFRS Foundation 35


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023


recreate the data. If it is impracticable to revise a comparative amount for the
preceding period, an entity shall disclose that fact.


**Errors**



B55


B56


B57


B58


B59



Paragraph 83 requires an entity to correct material prior period errors.


Such errors include: the effects of mathematical mistakes, mistakes in
applying the definitions for metrics or targets, oversights or
misinterpretations of facts, and fraud.


Potential reporting period errors discovered in that period are corrected before
the sustainability-related financial disclosures are authorised for issue.
However, material errors are sometimes not discovered until a subsequent
period.


If an entity identifies a material error in its prior period(s) sustainabilityrelated financial disclosures, it shall disclose:


(a) the nature of the prior period error;


(b) the correction, to the extent practicable, for each prior period
disclosed; and


(c) if correction of the error is impracticable, the circumstances that led to
the existence of that condition and a description of how and from
when the error has been corrected.


When it is impracticable to determine the effect of an error on all prior
periods presented, the entity shall restate the comparative information to
correct the error from the earliest date practicable.

This Standard requires (see paragraph 57) that in the absence of an IFRS
Sustainability Disclosure Standard that specifically applies to a sustainabilityrelated risk or opportunity, an entity shall apply judgement to identify
information that:


(a) is relevant to the decision-making of users of general purpose financial
reports; and


(b) faithfully represents that sustainability-related risk or opportunity.


In making that judgement, an entity may - to the extent that these sources
assist the entity in meeting the objective of this Standard (see paragraphs 1 - 4)
and do not conflict with IFRS Sustainability Disclosure Standards - refer to
and consider the applicability of:


(a) the Global Reporting Initiative Standards; and


(b) the European Sustainability Reporting Standards.


In applying the sources of guidance specified in paragraph C2, an entity shall
not obscure material information required by IFRS Sustainability Disclosure

IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION       - JUNE 2023


**Appendix D**
**Qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-related**
**financial information**


_This appendix is an integral part of IFRS S1 and has the same authority as the other parts of the_
_Standard._


**Introduction**



D1


D2


D3



The _Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework)_ was
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). It describes
the objective of, and the concepts that apply to, general purpose financial
reports. One purpose of the _Conceptual Framework_ is to assist the IASB to
develop IFRS Accounting Standards for preparing financial statements based
on consistent concepts.


Sustainability-related financial disclosures are part of general purpose
financial reports. The qualitative characteristics in the _Conceptual Framework_,
therefore, apply to sustainability-related financial information. However, the
nature of some of the information required to meet the objective of this
Standard (see paragraphs 1 - 4) differs in some respects from the information
provided in financial statements.


Sustainability-related financial information is useful if it is relevant and
faithfully represents what it purports to represent. Relevance and faithful
representation are fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful
sustainability-related financial information. The usefulness of sustainabilityrelated financial information is enhanced if the information is comparable,
verifiable, timely and understandable. Comparability, verifiability, timeliness
and understandability are enhancing characteristics of useful sustainabilityrelated financial information.



**Fundamental qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-**
**related financial information**


**Relevance**



D4


D5



Relevant sustainability-related financial information is capable of making a
difference in the decisions made by primary users. Information may be
capable of making a difference in a decision even if some users choose not to
take advantage of it or are already aware of it from other sources.
Sustainability-related financial information is capable of making a difference
in decisions made by users if it has predictive value, confirmatory value or
both.


Sustainability-related financial information has predictive value if it can be
used as an input to processes employed by primary users to predict future
outcomes. Sustainability-related financial information need not be a
prediction or forecast to have predictive value. Sustainability-related financial
information with predictive value is employed by primary users in making
their own predictions. For example, information about water quality, which



38 © IFRS Foundation


D6


D7


D8


D9


D10


D11


D12



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


can include information about the water being polluted, could inform the
expectations of users about the ability of an entity to meet local water-quality
requirements.


Sustainability-related financial information has confirmatory value if it
provides feedback about (confirms or changes) previous evaluations.


The predictive value and confirmatory value of sustainability-related financial
information are interrelated. Information that has predictive value often also
has confirmatory value. For example, information for the current year about
greenhouse gas emissions, which can be used as the basis for predicting
greenhouse gas emissions in future years, can also be compared with
predictions about greenhouse gas emissions for the current year that were
made in past years. The results of those comparisons can help a user to correct
and improve the processes that were used to make those previous predictions.


**Materiality**


Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring that information
could reasonably be expected to influence decisions that the primary users of
general purpose financial reports make on the basis of those reports, which
provide information about a specific reporting entity. In other words,
materiality is an entity-specific aspect of relevance. The materiality of
information is assessed in the context of an entity ’ s sustainability-related
financial disclosures and is based on the nature or magnitude of the item to
which the information relates, or both.


**Faithful representation**


Sustainability-related financial information represents phenomena in words
and numbers. To be useful, the information must not only represent relevant
phenomena, it must also faithfully represent the substance of the phenomena
that it purports to represent.


To be a faithful representation, a depiction would be complete, neutral and
accurate. The objective of general purpose financial reports is to maximise
those qualities to the extent possible.


A complete depiction of a sustainability-related risk or opportunity includes
all material information necessary for primary users to understand that risk
or opportunity.


Sustainability-related financial information shall be neutral. A neutral
depiction is one without bias in the selection or disclosure of information.
Information is neutral if it is not slanted, weighted, emphasised, deemphasised or otherwise manipulated to make it more likely that primary
users will receive that information favourably or unfavourably. Neutral
information is not information without purpose or without influence on
behaviour. On the contrary, relevant information is, by definition, capable of
making a difference in users ’ decisions.


© IFRS Foundation 39


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023



D13


D14


D15



Some sustainability-related financial information - for example, targets or
plans - is aspirational. A neutral discussion of such matters covers both
aspirations and the factors that could prevent an entity from achieving these
aspirations.


Neutrality is supported by the exercise of prudence. Prudence is the exercise
of caution when making judgements under conditions of uncertainty. The
exercise of prudence means that opportunities are not overstated and risks are
not understated. Equally, the exercise of prudence does not allow for the
understatement of opportunities or the overstatement of risks.


Sustainability-related financial information shall be accurate. Information can
be accurate without being perfectly precise in all respects. The precision
needed and attainable, and the factors that make information accurate,
depend on the nature of the information and the nature of the matters to
which it relates. For example, accuracy requires that:


(a) factual information is free from material error;


(b) descriptions are precise;


(c) estimates, approximations and forecasts are clearly identified as such;


(d) no material errors are made in selecting and applying an appropriate
process for developing an estimate, approximation or forecast;


(e) assertions and inputs used in developing estimates are reasonable and
based on information of sufficient quality and quantity; and


(f) information on judgements about the future faithfully reflects both
those judgements and the information on which they are based.



**Enhancing qualitative characteristics of useful sustainability-**
**related financial information**



D16


D17



The usefulness of sustainability-related financial information is enhanced if it
is comparable, verifiable, timely and understandable.


**Comparability**


The decisions made by the primary users of general purpose financial reports
involve choosing between alternatives; for example, selling or holding an
investment, or investing in one reporting entity or another. Comparability is
the characteristic that enables users to identify and understand similarities in,
and differences among, items. Unlike the other qualitative characteristics,
comparability does not relate to a single item. A comparison requires at least
two items. Information is more useful to users if it is also comparable, that is,
if it can be compared with:


(a) information provided by the entity in previous periods; and


(b) information provided by other entities, in particular those with similar
activities or operating within the same industry.

D18


D19


D20


D21


D22


D23


D24



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


Sustainability-related financial disclosures shall be provided in a way that
enhances comparability.


Consistency is related to, but is not the same as, comparability. Consistency
refers to the use of the same approaches or methods for providing disclosures
about the same sustainability-related risks and opportunities, from period to
period, both by a reporting entity and other entities. Comparability is the goal;
consistency helps to achieve that goal.


Comparability is not uniformity. For information to be comparable, like
things shall look alike and different things shall look different. Comparability
of sustainability-related financial information is not enhanced by making
unlike things look alike any more than it is enhanced by making like things
look different.


**Verifiability**


Verifiability helps to give users confidence that information is complete,
neutral and accurate. Information is verifiable if it is possible to corroborate
either the information itself or the inputs used to derive it. Verifiable
information is more useful to primary users than information that is not
verifiable.


Verifiability means that various knowledgeable and independent observers
could reach consensus, although not necessarily complete agreement, that a
particular depiction is a faithful representation. Quantified information need
not be a single point estimate to be verifiable. A range of possible amounts
and the related probabilities could also be verified.


Sustainability-related financial information shall be provided in a way that
enhances its verifiability. Verifiability can be enhanced by, for example:


(a) including information that can be corroborated by comparing it with
other information available to primary users about an entity ’ s
business, about other businesses or about the external environment in
which the entity operates;


(b) providing information about inputs and methods of calculation used to
produce estimates or approximations; and


(c) providing information reviewed and agreed by the entity ’ s board,
board committees or equivalent bodies.


Some sustainability-related financial information will be presented as
explanations or forward-looking information. That information can be
supportable, for example by faithfully representing fact-based strategies, plans
and risk analyses. To help primary users decide whether to use such
information, an entity shall describe the underlying assumptions and methods
of producing the information, as well as other factors that provide evidence
that the information reflects the actual plans or decisions made by the entity.


© IFRS Foundation 41


IFRS S1 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR DISCLOSURE OF SUSTAINABILITYRELATED FINANCIAL INFORMATION      - JUNE 2023


**Timeliness**



D25


D26


D27


D28


D29


D30


D31



Timeliness means having information available to decision-makers in time to
be capable of influencing their decisions. Generally, the older information is,
the less useful it is. However, some information may continue to be timely
long after the end of a reporting period because, for example, some users may
need to identify and assess trends.


**Understandability**


Sustainability-related financial information shall be clear and concise. For
sustainability-related financial disclosures to be concise, they need:


(a) to avoid generic information, sometimes called ‘ boilerplate ’, that is not
specific to the entity;


(b) to avoid duplication of information in the general purpose financial
reports, including unnecessary duplication of information also
provided in the related financial statements; and


(c) to use clear language and clearly structured sentences and paragraphs.


The clearest form a disclosure can take will depend on the nature of the
information and might include tables, graphs or diagrams in addition to
narrative text. If graphs or diagrams are used, additional text or tables might
be necessary to avoid obscuring material detail.


Clarity might be enhanced by distinguishing information about developments
in the reporting period from ‘ standing ’ information that remains unchanged,
or changes little, from one period to the next - for example, by separately
describing features of an entity ’ s sustainability-related governance and risk
management processes that have changed since the previous reporting period.


Disclosures are concise if they include only material information. Any
immaterial information included shall be provided in a way that avoids
obscuring material information.


Some sustainability-related risks and opportunities are inherently complex
and might be difficult to present in a manner that is easy to understand. An
entity shall present such information as clearly as possible. However, complex
information about these risks and opportunities shall not be excluded from
general purpose financial reports to make those reports easier to understand.
Excluding such information would render those reports incomplete and,
therefore, possibly misleading.


The completeness, clarity and comparability of sustainability-related financial
information all rely on information being presented as a coherent whole. For
sustainability-related financial information to be coherent, it shall be
presented in a way that explains the context and the connections between the
related items of information.



42 © IFRS Foundation


D32


D33



IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


If sustainability-related risks and opportunities located in one part of an
entity ’ s general purpose financial reports have implications for information
disclosed in other parts, the entity shall include the information necessary for
users to assess those implications.


Coherence also requires an entity to provide information in a way that allows
users to relate information about its sustainability-related risks and
opportunities to information in the entity ’ s financial statements.

_Standard._


**Effective date**



E1


E2



An entity shall apply this Standard for annual reporting periods beginning on
or after 1 January 2024. Earlier application is permitted. If an entity applies
this Standard earlier, it shall disclose that fact and apply IFRS S2 _Climate-related_
_Disclosures_ at the same time.


For the purposes of applying paragraphs E3 - E6, the date of initial application
is the beginning of the annual reporting period in which an entity first applies
this Standard.



**Transition**



E3


E4


E5


E6



An entity is not required to provide the disclosures specified in this Standard
for any period before the date of initial application. Accordingly, an entity is
not required to disclose comparative information in the first annual reporting
period in which it applies this Standard.


In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard,
the entity is permitted to report its sustainability-related financial disclosures
after it publishes its related financial statements. In applying this transition
relief, an entity shall report its sustainability-related financial disclosures:


(a) at the same time as its next second-quarter or half-year interim general
purpose financial report, if the entity is required to provide such an
interim report;


(b) at the same time as its next second-quarter or half-year interim general
purpose financial report, but within nine months of the end of the
annual reporting period in which the entity first applies this Standard,
if the entity voluntarily provides such an interim report; or


(c) within nine months of the end of the annual reporting period in which
the entity first applies this Standard, if the entity is not required to and
does not voluntarily provide an interim general purpose financial
report.


In the first annual reporting period in which an entity applies this Standard,
the entity is permitted to disclose information on only climate-related risks
and opportunities (in accordance with IFRS S2) and consequently apply the
requirements in this Standard only insofar as they relate to the disclosure of
information on climate-related risks and opportunities. If an entity uses this
transition relief, it shall disclose that fact.


If an entity uses the transition relief in paragraph E5:



44 © IFRS Foundation


IFRS SUSTAINABILITY DISCLOSURE STANDARDS


(a) in the first annual reporting period in which the entity applies this
Standard, it is not required to disclose comparative information about
its climate-related risks and opportunities (see paragraph E3); and


(b) in the second annual reporting period in which the entity applies this
Standard, it is not required to disclose comparative information about
its sustainability-related risks and opportunities, other than its
climate-related risks and opportunities.
